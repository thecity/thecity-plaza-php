This PHP project is meant to be used with OnTheCity (Software to enable communication and community in your church)

I started developing this project for my church (Living Stones - Reno, NV) as a way to pull church needs, topics, etc from the Plaza.

I am currently working out the structure so it is VERY alpha right now.


Requirements:
PHP >= 5.3

Libraries:
iconv


#tc
