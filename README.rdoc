= OnTheCity PHP Library

This PHP library is meant to be used with OnTheCity (Software to enable communication and community in your church).

It is possible to pull church needs, topics, events, prayers and albums from the Plaza so that you can use them as necessary.

Data pulled from TheCity is by default cached for 1 day (24 hours) so that subsequent requests are faster.
